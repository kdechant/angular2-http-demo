# Angular 2/4 HTTP Client Demo App

This is a demo application showing how to use the Http service and Observables in Angular 2/4.

For background on the topic of Angular 2/4 HTTP requests, please see my blog posts:

Note: This app uses the original Http service from Angular 2.x and Angular 4.x before 4.3.0. This library is deprecated
but still works with Anguluar 4.x.
 
This app will not work with rxjs version 5.5+, and therefore Angular 5.x, as of the time of this writing. 

# Running the app

To run this application, you need nodejs and npm installed on your system. Then, run the following commands from your command prompt:

```
npm install
npm start
```

This will transpile the TypeScript files and start the Node server. The app will be available at [http://localhost:3000/]()
